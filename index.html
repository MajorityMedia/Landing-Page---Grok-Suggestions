        <h2>Welcome to The Writer's Forge</h2>
        <p><em>The Forge isn't a class. It's not a PDF. And it sure as hell isn't some self-anointed guru handing out formulas.</em></p>
        <p><strong>There are no shortcuts.</strong></p>
        <p>Think of The Forge as a dojo:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A place to train</li>
            <li>To sweat</li>
            <li>To break lazy habits</li>
            <li>To get your ass kicked and come out sharper</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>We don't just build scripts here. We build writers.</em></p>

        <h2>Who I Am (and why I'm doing this)</h2>
        <h3>J. David Stem</h3>
        <p>20+ years as a professional screenwriter: Shrek 2, Rugrats, Jimmy Neutron, The Smurfs, Are We There Yet?, Disenchanted, Mission Hill</p>
        <p>It's been an incredible ride.</p>
        <p>But don't get it twisted — I wasn't a prodigy. I made every mistake you're making now:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Jumping into drafts too soon because the idea felt "so good it would write itself"</li>
            <li>Stalling out by page 30</li>
            <li>Rewriting the same dead script, clinging to broken pages I'd "worked so hard on"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We call that Polishing a Turd. Polite society calls it Putting Lipstick on a Pig.</p>
        <p><em>I built The Forge because if I'd known then what I know now, it would've saved me years of struggle. Some of those great ideas might have become great scripts. Instead, they sat in my attic until they burned in the Pacific Palisades fire.</em></p>
        <p><em>Out of the ashes, new things rise. That's what The Forge is about.</em></p>

        <h2>Who I'm Looking For</h2>
        <p>This isn't for dabblers.</p>
        <p>It's for writers who:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Know the loneliness of the page… and keep going anyway</li>
            <li>Are willing to bleed on the page — to get past clever, past safe, into something primal and human</li>
            <li>Can take real notes, not empty cheerleading</li>
            <li>Show up, rewrite when it hurts, hit deadlines, and genuinely want each other to succeed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you're looking for quick fixes or "Save the Cat" shortcuts, The Forge isn't for you.</p>
        <p>But if you're ready to train like a pro, this is where you belong.</p>
